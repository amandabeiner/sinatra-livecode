# Kickball League

A live-coded clinic to teach the basics of Test-Driven Development and feature and model testing with Rspec and Capybara.

You should run the test suite, and let the tests guide your development!

## Setup
To get set up, run the following:

```no-highlight
  bundle
  ruby app.rb
```
And navigate to `localhost:4567`.

To run your tests, run `rake`. Feel free to remove the line 3 of the `.rspec` file to see all failing tests at once.
